# FEZ Content Formats

FEZ is a game built on Microsoft XNA Game Studio, which distributes all its content as a binary data stored in a proprietary XNB format. This format is then packed into a simple containers with `.pak` extension. This specification defines the format of these containers and XNB files with attention to details specific to FEZ.

Keep in mind that underlying knowledge of these formats is **not** required for modding purposes, as our current modding environment takes advantage of content conversion to more user-friendly formats. For more information, visit [Content Conversion](/Content%20Conversion.md) page.
