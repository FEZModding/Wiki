# Content Conversion

All content of the game is hidden behind multiple formats and a layer of compression (for more information, read [FEZ Content Formats](./FEZ Content Formats.md)), which makes them very hard to access for modders. In order to work around this, [FEZRepacker](https://github.com/FEZModding/FEZRepacker) was created to allow an easy conversion between these proprietary formats and more user-friendly ones. Additionally, Repacker is included as part of [HAT mod loader](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT), allowing the game to directly access the content without having to convert it back to its own format, giving us a seamless modding experience.

This specification explains a general approach of content conversion and a structure of converted assets. To get more detailed information about the specific asset format, consult the specific format reference.
